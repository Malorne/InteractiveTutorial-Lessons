We have completed our own Alien World already, but we may want to connect our world with other's in the future.

In the TypeScript NEO smart contract, we can call other contract's methods in the following way,

```typescript
import { Address, Fixed, SmartContract } from '@neo-one/smart-contract';

interface Token {
  readonly transfer: (from: Address, to: Address, amount: Fixed<8>) => string | false;
}

const tokenAddress = Address.from('APyEx5f4Zm4oCHwFWiSTaph1fPBxZacYVR');

export class Example extends SmartContract {
  public attemptTransfer(from: Address, to: Address, amount: Fixed<8>): void {
    // Reference a smart contract with an interface that matches Token at tokenAddress.
    const smartContract = SmartContract.for<Token>(tokenAddress);
    if (smartContract.transfer(from, to, amount) === false) {
      // do something on failure
    } else {
      // do something else on success
    }
  }
}
```

Here we first declare another contract's interface, and use `SmartContract.for<>()` to reference itself. When calling one of the methods in the interface, we just need to write `contract.mothod(parameters)`.

Remember to handle the condition that the calling fails. Normally we might use a `try/catch` here, but errors don't propagate across smart contract boundaries. It means that we will never receive an error from other contracts. If an error is thrown, the entire transaction immediately fails. So here instead, we expect the method on the other contract to return `false`.
